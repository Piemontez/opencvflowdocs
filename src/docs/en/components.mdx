All functionality and components of opencv flow are added via plugin.

To create your own components, just create a new plugin and add the components to the plugin.

## Creating Components

The basic composition of a component is composed of a menu and a processor.

The menu contains the name of the component shown in the top bar.

The processor contains the class that processes data from nodes connected to the component.

```typescript
import { CVFComponent } from 'renderer/types/component';

export class CustomComponent extends CVFIOComponent {
  //Nav Bar Menu link Definitions
  static menu = { tabTitle: "Top Tab Bar", title: 'Menu name' };

  // Class responsible for processing data cycles or images frames
  static processor = class CustomNode extends CVFNodeProcessor {
    //Function called when starting processing (click run). one time call
    async start(): Promise<void> {
      ...
    }
    //Function called every new operation cycle/frame
    async proccess(): Promise<void> {
      ...
    }
    //Function called when stopping processing. one time call
    async stop(): Promise<void> {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding Plugin

To add a plugin, just create a Typescript Object that extends the PluginType type and add this object to the plugins file located in "./src/plugin/index.tsx".

```typescript
import { PluginType } from 'renderer/types/plugin';

const CustomPlugin: PluginType = {
  name: 'Custom Plugin',
  components: [
    ...CustomComponents
  ],
};

export default CustomPlugin;
```
