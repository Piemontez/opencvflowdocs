Image segmentation is an image processing task in which the image is segmented or partitioned into multiple regions such that pixels in the same region share common characteristics.

## Threshold

One of the most commonly used segmentation techniques is thresholding. It is widely used in computer vision and is very useful for separating the object we are interested in from the background.

Thresholding is the process of binarizing an image. This is the most basic type of thresholding, it consists of separating the grayscale matrix/image into a binary (black and white) image.
