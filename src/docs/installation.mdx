description: 'OpenCV-Flow Installation'
---

The project is developed in node version 14. 
So far, lower node versions have not been tested and we donÂ´t know whether the IDE works in these versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piemontez/opencvflow.git

cd opencvflow

npm install
```

## Build Requiriment
The OpencvFlow require node installed on computer. 

Maybe inner dependencies need [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) installed on your computer too. 
And because of this you need the install Python as instructed by node-gyp.


## Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Source

The project's source code is available on [github](https://github.com/piemontez/opencvflow).
