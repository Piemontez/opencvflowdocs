IO Endless Component is similar to IO Component, with the only difference, the amount of inputs is unlimited. 
As new inputs are connected, new inputs and outputs are created.

![OpenCV-Flow Example](../assets/canny_io_endless_comp.webp)

Below is the component created to process the Canny edge detector from the opencv library represented in the image above.

```typescript
export class CannyComponent extends CVFIOEndlessComponent {
  static processor = class SobelProcessor extends CVFNodeProcessor {
    async proccess() {
      this.sources = [];
      for (const src of this.inputs) {
        const dst = new cv.Mat(src.rows, src.cols, cv.CV_8UC1);

        cv.cvtColor(src, src, cv.COLOR_RGB2GRAY, 0);
        cv.Canny(src,dst, 80, 170);

        this.sources.push(dst);
        this.output(dst);
      }
    }
  };
}
```
