All functionality and components of opencv flow are added via plugin.

To create your own components, just create a new plugin and add the components to the plugin.

## Creating Components

## Adding Plugin

To add a plugin, just create a Typescript Object that extends the PluginType type and add this object to the plugins file located in "./src/plugin/index.tsx".

```typescript
import { PluginType } from 'renderer/types/plugin';

const CustomPlugin: PluginType = {
  name: 'Custom Plugin',
  components: [
    ...
  ],
};

export default CustomPlugin;
```
